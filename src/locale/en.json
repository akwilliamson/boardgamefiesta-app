De sleutel tot succes ligt in een goede organisatie: assistenten vullen de handkarren bij de diverse pakhuizen en brengen deze vervolgens met gezwinde spoed naar de juiste bestemming.\n\nElke handelaar wil namelijk als eerste een bepaald aantal robijnen in zijn bezit krijgen. Zet je assistenten slim in en probeer de kostbare edelstenen sneller dan je tegenstanders te verzamelen in dit strategische spel!"

This earns you money and victory points.<br/>Needless to say: Each time you arrive in Kansas City, you want to have your most valuable cattle in tow. This will not only require that you keep your herd in good shape, but also that you effectively utilize the various buildings along the trail.<br/>Success will require that you hire capable staff: Cowboys to improve your herd, craftsmen to build your very own buildings and engineers to manage the important railroad line.<br/><br/>If you cleverly manage your herd and navigate the opportunities and pitfalls of this great western trail, you surely will gain the most victory points and win the game."
